# ToDo

This is a ToDo where i will be writting down what does our project's ai service still need.

# List
- [ ] Better introduction
- [ ] Better data analisys
- [ ] Preprocessing
    - [ ] More advanced preprocessing?
- [X] Modeling
    - [X] Introduction
        - [X] Change PRACTICAL CONSTRAINTS according to the final answer
    - [X] Explain each model

    - [X] Write scalable algorithms at the start of the section to use with different models when needed. For fair comparissons
    - [X] interpretability algorithm: Explain why is a good idea. Write a code summary to explain better how does that works.
    - [X] Choose the best model configurations according to the defined metrics in the introduction
    - [ ] Explain better the choosen model output, and interpretation
    - [ ] Configure final model deployment
    - [ ] Fix / change final model's output system
- [ ] Documentation
    - [ ] Define and sort most important parameters that will be used for interpretation purposes. 


- [ ] Change model.conf
- [ ] Change main.py
